          I started this project as a way to learn <mark>Cloud Computing</mark>. This is a simple static resume built by [Jekyll](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll) and hosted on Github (a cloud service platform). You can check out how to create Jekyll Theme Gem [here](https://medium.com/@jameshamann/creating-your-own-jekyll-theme-gem-1f8180a0e4b8) and more reference for this resume template [here](https://github.com/sproogen/modern-resume-theme). Within this lab, I will briefly introduce the steps to build this website as follow:
          
          #### **Create Repository**  
          
          Create a repository on GitHub to host the resume. You can find out how to do that [here](https://pages.github.com/).
          
          #### `_config.yml`
          
          This will contain all of the main configuration for the resume such as your name, email, social media links, and about me content.
          
          #### **Content**
          
          The main content for the resume will all come under the content property in the `_config.yml` file. This can be quite complex and a good understanding of [YAML](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html) will be helpful. Content will contain an array of sections, there are currently 2 types of layouts for content sections, **text** and **list**. **text** is a basic layout that contains markdown content. **list** is the standard layout used for sections like *Education* and *Experience*. Below is the full list of content options:
          ```
          content:
          - title: Section Name
            layout: list (options: list, text)
            content:
              - layout: left (options: left, right, top, top-right, top-middle)(default: left)
                title: Name of item (eg. Company or Project name)
                sub_title: Sub title (eg. Qualification or Job title)(optional)
                caption: Item caption (eg. Employment or course dates)(optional)
                link: Web link (eg. https://sproogen.github.io/modern-resume-theme)(optional)
                link_text: Text for link (optional: without this link will show URL as link text)
                additional_links: (optional)
                  - title: Link name
                    icon: Font Awesome brand icon name (eg. fab fa-twitter) (https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&s=brands&m=free)
                    url: Link url (eg. https://google.com)
                quote: >
                  Short overview or quote for the item
                description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
                  Main content area for the list item.
          - title: Section Name
            layout: text (options: list, text)
            content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
              This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.
        
              Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
          ```
          ***Note:** The description or content areas (fields starting with `| #`) use markdown, this means that you have the ability to format the section in many different ways and add things such as images, code & syntax highlighting, and tables. You can find more on Markdown cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)*
          
          #### **Additional links**
          
          If you would like to add more than the predefined social links in the config file, then you can use the `additional_links` field to add as many additional links with URLs and font-awesome icons as you wish.
          
          #### **Dark mode**
          
          Dark mode is configured via `_config.yml`  
          ```
          darkmode: true (options: true, false, never)
          ```
          When dark mode is `true` the site will show the dark theme for everyone  
          When dark mode is `false` the site will not show the dark theme, but it will still respect the user's device preferences  
          When dark mode is `never` the site will never be shown in the dark theme
          
          #### **Heading Anchors**

          You can link to section titles using a Markdown anchor link, e.g.: [About me](#about-me). The link after the # is the slug version of the title.
          You can link to section titles using a Markdown anchor link, e.g.: `[About me](#about-me)`. The link after the `#` is the slug version of the title.
          
          #### `assets/main.scss`
          
          Add any css changes or additions you want to make here after the line `@import 'modern-resume-theme';`
